          <p className='mt-8 max-sm:text-sm'>An athletic scholarship is a form of financial aid awarded to student-athletes based on their athletic abilities and performance. These scholarships are typically offered by colleges and universities to recruit talented athletes for their sports teams. Athletic scholarships can cover a range of expenses, including tuition, fees, room and board, and sometimes additional costs like books and equipment</p>
          <p className='mt-8 max-sm:text-sm'>There are two main types of athletic scholarships: full scholarships and partial scholarships. A full scholarship covers all the major expenses associated with attending college, while a partial scholarship covers a portion of these costs. Athletic scholarships are not just about sports performance; they also often require maintaining a certain academic standard and following team and university policies. Student-athletes receiving these scholarships are expected to commit to their sport, attend practices and games, and contribute positively to the team. These scholarships can provide a significant financial benefit to student-athletes, allowing them to pursue higher education while continuing to develop their athletic skills. They are awarded based on a combination of the athlete's skill level, the needs of the team, and the availability of funds within the athletic program.</p>
